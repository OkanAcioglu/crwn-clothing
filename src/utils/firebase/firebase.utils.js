  //1 db --> database
  //2 collections --> we gonna call it users collection
  //3 identifier --> unique id (When we look the response (user object that comes with access token) when we signInWithGooglePopup there is a uid which is "unique id identifier". We will use this uid... )
  //!!! Right now we are creating user instance inside the firestorm. We never done that before and we will use that userAuth.uid... Ä°t is interesting that Google Firestorm ,eventhough we do not have a document reference inside our database (we do not even have a user collection), generate the object for us... But when invoke the createUserDocumentFromAuth function into the sign-in component with user argument we see a object in the console. This object is actually the object that represents some document reference in the database. However we do not have a value but in the object there is uid we just used and the path that points to the collection of users. But we know that nothing exist there(no data we can get from there). Why Google create this for us? Because this reference points to the some unique point inside of the database. Google wants us to use this specific document reference object that they provided us in order to set data there because it is already pointing to the some place inside of our database.

  console.log(userSnapShot.exists())
