  //! whether there is existing document reference
  //! reference is a special type of object that firestore uses when talking about actual instance of a document modal
  //* 3 arguments of doc
  //1 db --> database
  //2 collections --> we gonna call it users collection
  //3 identifier --> unique id (When we look the response (user object that comes with access token) when we signInWithGooglePopup there is a uid which is "unique id identifier". We will use this uid... )
  //!!! Right now we are creating user instance inside the firestorm. We never done that before and we will use that userAuth.uid... Ä°t is interesting that Google Firestorm ,eventhough we do not have a document reference inside our database (we do not even have a user collection), generate the object for us... But when invoke the createUserDocumentFromAuth function into the sign-in component with user argument we see a object in the console. This object is actually the object that represents some document reference in the database. However we do not have a value but in the object there is uid we just used and the path that points to the collection of users. But we know that nothing exist there(no data we can get from there). Why Google create this for us? Because this reference points to the some unique point inside of the database. Google wants us to use this specific document reference object that they provided us in order to set data there because it is already pointing to the some place inside of our database.
  const userDocRef = doc(db, 'users', userAuth.uid) // give me the document reference, inside of the database, under the user collection, with the userAuth.uid
  console.log(userDocRef)
  //? userSnapShot --> kind of data , also the specific kind of object...
  const userSnapShot = await getDoc(userDocRef)
  console.log(userSnapShot) // new document snap shot --> points to same identifier --> but this is a special object --> on this object we can check whether or not document exist... ( for now we know it doesnt)
  console.log(userSnapShot.exists())

  // if user data does not exist
  if (!userSnapShot.exists()) {
    // create/set the document with the data from userAuth in the collection
    const { displayName, email } = userAuth
    const createdAt = new Date()
    try {
      await setDoc(userDocRef, { displayName, email, createdAt })
    } catch (error) {
      console.log('error creating the user', error.message)
    }
  }
  //check if user data exist --> above if block will not be executed
  // return userDocRef
  return userDocRef
